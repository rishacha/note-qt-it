## AIM

Our aim is to create a new opensource editor which combines all the goodies from various note taking apps and utilities. 

We want to create a better system which is very fast and can combine the whole data into a `Wiki-like` linkage.

The editor should support various formats for note taking. One of the most popular and wanted format would be [Markdown](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Markdown) and [reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).

Plugins can be integrated into the system easily.
